# How to run
- Open command prompt in root folder
- Execute `py ./main.py x` where x is any number that sets the length of the list of lights, if no x is given then the list will be 20
- In the program, the user can enter certain commands and these are:
    - `run`: This command will switch on and off each lights by 1 second and can be interrupted by clicking `ctrl+c`
    - `set x y`: x is the position of the y in the list and y can be any colour you want the y to be
    - `exit`: this will exit the program
